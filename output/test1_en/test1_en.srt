1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I'll take a coke.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Is Pepsi okay?

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Is Pepsi okay?

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Is Pepsi okay?

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Oh!

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Our puppy is okay.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Is a shooting star okay?

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Is the laughter of a small child?

9
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Okay.

10
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Are you with me?

11
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You seem confused.

12
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's roll play.

13
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now.

14
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Okay.

15
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm Steve.

16
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm an actor.

17
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't know.

18
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Just order something.

19
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'll handle that.

20
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A nice cold glass of the best thing you ever tasted.

21
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Okay.

22
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay.

23
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I think you might be just saying it wrong.

24
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You gotta say it with pride.

25
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay.

26
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,500
Okay.

27
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Oh yeah.

28
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Kind of.

29
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Pepsi's more than okay.

30
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,500
It's okay.

31
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Okay.

32
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,500
Okay.

33
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Okay.

34
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,500
What if we learn today?

35
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
You want a Pepsi?

36
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,500
I want a Pepsi.

37
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,500
She wants a Pepsi.

38
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,500
Here you go.

39
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,500
Okay.

40
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Like a little John.

41
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Okay.

42
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,500
I've got to come up with my own catchphrase.

43
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
Okay.
