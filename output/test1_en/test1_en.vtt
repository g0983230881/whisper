00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
I'll take a coke.

00:01.000 --> 00:02.000
Is Pepsi okay?

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
Is Pepsi okay?

00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
Is Pepsi okay?

00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Oh!

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
Our puppy is okay.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Is a shooting star okay?

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Is the laughter of a small child?

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Okay.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Are you with me?

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
You seem confused.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
Let's roll play.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Now.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Okay.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
I'm Steve.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
I'm an actor.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
I don't know.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Just order something.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
I'll handle that.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
A nice cold glass of the best thing you ever tasted.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
Okay.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Okay.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
I think you might be just saying it wrong.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
You gotta say it with pride.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Okay.

00:29.000 --> 00:29.500
Okay.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.500
Oh yeah.

00:30.500 --> 00:31.500
Kind of.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.500
Pepsi's more than okay.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.500
It's okay.

00:34.500 --> 00:35.500
Okay.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.500
Okay.

00:36.500 --> 00:37.500
Okay.

00:37.500 --> 00:44.500
What if we learn today?

00:44.500 --> 00:45.500
You want a Pepsi?

00:45.500 --> 00:46.500
I want a Pepsi.

00:46.500 --> 00:47.500
She wants a Pepsi.

00:47.500 --> 00:48.500
Here you go.

00:48.500 --> 00:49.500
Okay.

00:49.500 --> 00:52.500
Like a little John.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.500
Okay.

00:54.500 --> 00:58.500
I've got to come up with my own catchphrase.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.500
Okay.
